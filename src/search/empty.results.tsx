        <p>This is a simple <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> commander search.</p>
        <p>
            When making a commander deck, I usually have in mind the cards I want to use, or at least know what keywords I would want to be using.
            This search is set up to make that easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few sample searches:
        </p>
        <p>Name: dragon, Type: elder to get 5 big dragons</p>
        <p>Name: bridge, Type: art, Text: hand to get the ensnaring bridge, there are 5 different ones</p>
    </div>
