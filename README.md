# Simple Commander Card Search

Data Source: [Magic: The Gathering.IO](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/#documentationgetting_started)

Field Filters: Name of the card, Type of the card, and Text on the card.

I did not use the SDK either for reference or to create this sample.

It is set up to order the results by name, and only show cards with images.

## How To See In Action

### I don't wanna run it

Open it in [Github Pages](https://rangoric.github.io/commandersearch)

### I wanna run it

This was created using the create-react scripts, so those scripts are available. I used yarn for it but you can use npm for anything but the deploy.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
