# Simple Commander Card Search

Data Source: [Magic: The Gathering.IO](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/#documentationgetting_started)

Field Filters: Name of the card, Type of the card, and Text on the card.

I did not use the SDK either for reference or to create this sample.

It is set up to order the results by name, and only show cards with images.

## Available Scripts

This was created using the create-react scripts, so those scripts are available.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
